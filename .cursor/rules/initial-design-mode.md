> **PROTOTYPING MODE INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI:**
> - We are in prototyping mode
> - Develop frontend only, we are mocking up the interface
> - Use dummy JSON to represent data
> - Link all components for navigation
> - Make buttons responsive
> - Don't connect to backend logic
> - Initially, don't connect to a database - use mock data only until UI implementation is complete
